# SensaWeb Geiger Muller Counter data collector for RaspberryPi + USB GMC-320
## sensa-rpi-gmc
This application is intended to run as a daemon on a RaspberryPi with a US?B attached GMC-320, saving radiation data to a file at given time intervals.

It is expected that another daemon will deal with transferring the files to data collection points (whether that is a GCP Pub/Sub MTTQ endpoint, a file server, an FTP server, a REST or API interface or similar...)
